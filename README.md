# Fake-News-Detection

he primary objective of this code is to build a model that can classify news articles as either "fake" or "real" based on the text content.

What the Code Does:
Data Loading:

The script begins by loading a dataset containing news articles and their corresponding labels (real or fake). This dataset is typically in a CSV format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

It likely involves inspecting the data to understand its structure, distribution, and any potential imbalances between real and fake news articles.
Text Preprocessing:

The script processes the text data to prepare it for modeling. This usually includes steps like converting text to lowercase, removing stop words (common words like "the", "and", etc.), punctuation, and tokenizing the text (breaking it down into words or phrases).
Feature Extraction:

The script transforms the text into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can work with. This might involve using methods like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Count Vectorization to convert words into vectors of numbers.
Model Training:

The processed data is then used to train a machine learning model. Common models for text classification include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or even more complex models like Neural Networks.
Evaluation:

After training the model, the script evaluates its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine how well the model is at predicting whether a news article is fake or real.
Application:

Finally, the script might include a section where the trained model is used to predict the class (fake or real) of new, unseen news articles.
